The large feline, thought to be a rare Savannah breed, caused alarm when it was seen in Winnington Road, East Finchley, north London. Scotland Yard said firearms officers and an animal expert - to assess the threat posed by the leopard-spotted interloper - were sent to the scene. After it was deemed safe, the cat ran off. Its owner has yet to be found. The Met said officers rushed to the neighbourhood - reportedly dubbed "billionaire's row" on account of the high property prices - at 21:00 BST on Monday. A resident's garden was sealed off, the force said, while the animal expert assessed whether the beast was a danger to the public. Upon viewing the cat, they concluded it was a hybrid, "namely a cross-breed of a domestic cat and a Savannah cat". THE MAIN OFFICER SAID: "THIS EVENT WILL NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED TO AVOID A PRECEDENT, AND I WILL ENSURE THIS TO BE DONE". There have been no reports of attacks or injuries to members of the public, according to MPS Barnet. A Met Police spokesperson said the "matter has been logged for intelligence purposes" and "no offences were disclosed". "Police have not been able to trace the cat's owner at this time," they added. THE OWNER OF THE FELINE HAS BEEN CONVOCATED TO THE POLICE STATION AND WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN. In most cases, Savannah cats, which are a cross between a domestic cat and a Serval wild African cat, are legal to own in the UK.
SCOTLAND YARD WILL DECIDE HOW TO HANDLE SIMILAR CASES IN THE FUTURE.
